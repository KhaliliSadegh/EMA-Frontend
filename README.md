## Getting Started

After confirming that your development environment meets the specified [requirements](#requirements), you can clone the project by doing the following:

### Install from source

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/KhaliliSadegh/EMA-Frontend
$ cd EMA-Frontend
```

### Pre setup
You can edit the config at api.config.js but it's not necessary

### Install project dependencies and launch
Then install dependencies and check to see it works. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic installs, but `npm install` will work just as well.

```bash
$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start      # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
```
